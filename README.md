# Alura MIDI

Alura MIDI is a digital interface (MIDI) musical instrument, which reproduces sounds of musical instruments, for the time being of a drum set, when the user clicks or presses its buttons with the keyboard.

## üî® Project features

MIDI has a digital keyboard with 9 buttons, each button will play the sound of a given musical instrument. The HTML will load the media files with the sound of the instruments through the `<audio>` element, and with MIDI we will control the playback of these media files by clicking on their `<button>` elements. There will be 9 different sounds.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

- `HTML`: HTML plays a fundamental role for the application to work correctly with the insertion of `<audio>` elements that will provide JavaScript with the playback controls for the loaded media. The HTML will already be ready in the initial course files;
- `CSS`: CSS has a fundamental role to indicate the user's interaction with the graphical interface, therefore it indicates when the buttons are pressed by mouse or keyboard. The CSS will already be ready in the initial files of the course;
- `JavaScript`: JavaScript will allow us to program the dynamic control of playing a sound, which at first is being carried out by the `<audio>` element, and we will pass this control to the `<button>` elements, with all the care to make an intelligent code , without repetition, which also takes care of the visual aspects with dynamic CSS. Below are some topics covered in the course:
  - `querySelector`;
  - `document`;
  - `const`;
  - `function`;
  - `while`;
  - `for`;
  - `if`;
  - `else`;
  - `template string`;
  - `event handlers`;
